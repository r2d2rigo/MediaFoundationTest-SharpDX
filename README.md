# MediaFoundationTest-SharpDX
A sample Windows Phone Silverlight app for streaming a video to a Direct3D texture through MediaFoundation.

Not the cleanest code out there but should serve its purpose.

## WARNING

Uses a custom version of https://github.com/r2d2rigo/SharpDX.SimpleInitializer so the video streaming works.
